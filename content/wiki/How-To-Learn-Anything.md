# How To Learn Anything

Learn anything

1. WHAT

   - What is it?
   - What problems have been solved?
   - How should I use it?

2. HOW

   - How to implement it?

3. WHY

   - Why was it designed this way?

     > Why doesn't C++ have a 'finally' keyword like Java

Goal

Goal Setting

- **Reasonable**: Goals that are too easy may not provide enough help for growth, while those that are too difficult may lead to giving up half or exceeding the time allotted.
- **Evaluable**: Set goals that can be easily evaluated, otherwise one may not be able to determine whether the goal has been achieved or not

Three Goals

- Short-term goal

  Usually a matter of days, weeks, or month

  >"My goal for this month is to complete reading the MDN documentation."

- Mid-term goal

  Usually a matter of months or years

  >My goal is to become a proficient Frontend development programmer within one year

- Long-term goal

  Usually a matter of years or five years

  > Become a technical director within 5 years

Review

- You should evaluate the completion of each goal and reflect on the gains, experiences, and lessons learned when each stage ends.
- If necessary, adjustments can be made to subsequent goals.
- Regular reviews also have the benefit of providing a sense of fulfillment, which helps you persevere and complete the entire plan.

### Different stages of learning

- Basic

  When we are at the beginning of a skill, we should prefer the guidance of a tutor.

  1. We can model the tutorial to complete the project.
  2. Once you have completed the tutor, try completing the project on your own. If you encounter any problems, refer back to the tutorial.
  3. Repeat the process until complete the project.

- Proficiency

  Expanding Learning: Build the things that you are interested in.
