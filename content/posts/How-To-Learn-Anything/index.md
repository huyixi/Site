# How To Learn Anything

### Set Goal

Choose reasonable goal

- **Reasonable**: Goals that are too easy may not provide enough help for growth, while those that are too difficult may lead to giving up half or exceeding the time allotted.
- **Evaluable**: Set goals that can be easily evaluated, otherwise one may not be able to determine whether the goal has been achieved or not

Three-term Goals

- Short-term goal

  Usually a matter of days, weeks, or month

  >"My goal for this month is to complete reading the MDN documentation."

- Mid-term goal

  Usually a matter of months or years

  >My goal is to become a proficient Frontend development programmer within one year

- Long-term goal

  Usually a matter of years or five years

  > Become a technical director within 5 years

Review

- You should evaluate the completion of each goal and reflect on the gains, experiences, and lessons learned when each stage ends.
- If necessary, adjustments can be made to subsequent goals.
- Regular reviews also have the benefit of providing a sense of fulfillment, which helps you persevere and complete the entire plan.



### Choose Medium

**Books are the best medium(bar none)**

#### The drawback of video

- Less thinking

  The "video" is played at a fixed rate, so the audience of the video must adapt to its playback rate **[ passively ]**; relatively video, when reading text, the reader is [**active**], because the reader can control the reading speed freely and flexibly.

- More shallow content

  More video creators will make their content more shallow, in order to attract a large enough audience.

- More Entertaining

  - Any medium, as long as it becomes popular enough, can be linked to economic benefits.

  - In any society, emotional people are always far more numerous than rational people.

  - Emotional people are more prone to getting addicted to "entertaining media" 

- Heavier burden

  When watching a video, the brain has to process both visual and auditory information, making it difficult for the brain to engage in deep thinking.

- Lower time efficiency

  - It takes significantly less time to read a piece of text with your eyes than to speak it out loud.

  - Video versions often have a lot of "**[ unproductive space ]**" (such as meaningless conversation), Text can avoid the blank time in videos.



#### Evaluating the value of information

**DIKW pyramid**

1. Data

   Data refers to raw, unprocessed information that has no meaning or value. Data can take the form of numbers, text, sound, images, and other forms of information.

2. Information

   Information is data that has been organized, meaningful, and understandable. It can help us understand facts and relationships in specific contexts.

3. Knowledge

   Knowledge is the understanding and application of information, representing the mastery of professional knowledge, experience, and skills in a particular field. Knowledge can be acquired through learning, practice, experience, and other means.

4. Wisdom

   Wisdom is the creative application of knowledge and judgment. It not only solves problems but also helps us understand a broader context and make correct decisions and actions.

Example of Health:

1. Data: A set of numerical data such as height, weight, and age, which are not processed or interpreted, but simply a collection of numbers.

2. Information: By performing calculations on the above data, we can obtain a person's body mass index (BMI), which is an organized, meaningful, and understandable piece of information extracted from the data.

3. Knowledge: Based on the understanding and application of BMI, we can determine whether the person is within a healthy weight range and provide advice on how to improve their health. This demonstrates the application of professional knowledge and experience in the health field.

4. Wisdom: Based on the above knowledge and experience, we can judge and decide on the best ways to improve health, such as developing a healthy diet and exercise plan and sticking to it. This demonstrates the creative use of knowledge and judgment, reflecting the level of wisdom.

Example of Shopping:

1. Data: In the process of buying a house, collected data may include the location, size, price, age, structure, and decoration of the house, among others. These are just raw numbers or facts that need to be further processed.

2. Information: By processing and transforming the data, more meaningful information can be obtained. For example, analyzing the house price, size, and location can provide information on the average housing price in a certain area, as well as the price range for similar properties. This information can help you better understand the real estate market trends.

3. Knowledge level: By analyzing and applying the information, conclusions and ideas can be formed, which make up the knowledge level. For example, taking into account your budget and needs, you can identify an ideal neighborhood for purchasing a house, as well as factors to consider such as school districts and transportation. This knowledge can help you better plan and make decisions.

4. Wisdom level: Finally, comprehensive decisions and actions based on knowledge and experience form the wisdom level. For example, considering factors such as budget, needs, and the characteristics of the area, you can decide which house to buy and how to communicate with real estate agents and negotiate the price. These comprehensive decisions and actions can help you achieve your purchasing goals.



### Learning methods

#### What, How, Why

For Coding

1. WHAT

   - What is it?
   - What problems have been solved?
   - How should I use it?

2. HOW

   - How to implement it?

3. WHY

   - Why was it designed this way?

     > Why doesn't C++ have a 'finally' keyword like Java

Otherwise

1. What

   What is it? (What is the fact?)

   - Time
   - Location
   - Individuals
   - The sequence of events

2. How

   How to do?

   - How did the parties involve participate in the event?
   - What other factors come into play besides the parties involved?
     - Culture
     - Legal
     - Economic
     - Technology
   - What was the step-by-step development of the event?

3. Why

   - Why did this factor come into play instead of that factor?
   - Why did the event develop in this direction instead of another direction?

### Different stages of learning

- Basic

  When we are at the beginning of a skill, we should prefer the guidance of a tutor.

  1. We can model the tutorial to complete the project.
  2. Once you have completed the tutor, try completing the project on your own. If you encounter any problems, refer back to the tutorial.
  3. Repeat the process until complete the project.

- Proficiency

  Expanding Learning: Build the things that you are interested in.
